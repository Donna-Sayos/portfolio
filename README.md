## Description

Hey there! 👋 

I'm an aspiring Software Developer and this repository is my personal portfolio repo that I worked very hard on.

You'll see a brief summary of who I am, my skillsets that are continuously growing, the projects I've worked on, some testimonials from my mentors and peers I've worked with, my updated resume, and a way to contact me if you're interested in having a little chat!

Feel free to stop by and check it out!

I worked very hard on this and I tried my best to make it responsive 😁.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed making it!
